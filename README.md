# qskill-frontend-internship

A multi-page React SPA built as the Slab 1 deliverable for my **Frontend Development Internship at QSkill** (Squarcell Resource India Pvt. Ltd), June–July 2026.

The project covers all three required tasks - a live text translator, a configurable random string generator, and client-side routing connecting them as a single seamless app.

### Text Translator - `/translator`

- Takes English text as input
- Lets you pick a target language from a dropdown (20 languages supported)
- Sends a POST request to `google-translator9.p.rapidapi.com` via Axios

- Auto-generates on page load and re-generates whenever settings change
- Manual "Re-Generate" button
- One-click clipboard copy with visual confirmation
- Uses `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` for cryptographically random output

**React hooks used:** `useState`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
cd qskill-frontend-internship
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure your environment variables

The Translator requires a RapidAPI key. Copy the example file and fill in your key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace the placeholder:

```
VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

**How to get a RapidAPI key:**

1. Go to [https://rapidapi.com](https://rapidapi.com) and create a free account
2. Search for **Google Translator** (by IRCTCAPI)
3. Subscribe to the free tier
4. Copy your `X-RapidAPI-Key` from the API dashboard

> **Note:** The String Generator works without any API key. Only the Translator page needs one.

> **Warning:** Never commit your `.env` file - it is already listed in `.gitignore`.
